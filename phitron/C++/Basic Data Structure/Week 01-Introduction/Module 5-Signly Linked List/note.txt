why a linked list needed?
-> to reduce siquentiality form of array because of memory efficiency. and value is stored in random memory address and got linked.
-> to increase size continuously that array can't do.

why we use dynamic object for linked list:
1. when a function is return the object will be deleted. though we do not return the object. so the linked value will be removed.
2. if we don't need the object we need to delete . so we shouldncreate dynamic object all the time.
