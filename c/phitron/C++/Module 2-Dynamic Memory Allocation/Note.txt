/* stack memory's problem */
stack memory can not allow to
1. extend the memory size in run time
2. it can not return a full array because it removes its data after a function return .

heap do not give you variable. it gives the address of the variable that is created in the heap memory.

declaration ->

int * a ( stack part ) = new int ( heap part );
*a = 5; // dereferencing the address for store a value
cout<<*a<<endl; // " a " means the address of the heap memory. " *a " means the value that stored in a.

for dynamic array declaration ->

int * a = new int[5]; // it makes an array in heap memory and gives you the 1st index . then the rest of the works will be same as statice memory.
