Graph is a linear data structure. It is not sequential.It is a connection of nodes and edges.
The terms of the Graphs are:
1. Terminologies
2. Representaion
3. Traversal
4. Graph algorithms


Graph has many types:
1. by Direction->
    1.Directed Graph
    2.Undirected Graph
2. by Weight->
    1.Weighted
    2.Unweighted
and others (directed Weighted , directed Unweighted, Undirected Weighted, Undirected Unweighted etc.)
special graph is tree.
