difference between array and linked list time complexity
1. insert in any postion both are O(N);
2. insert at tail linked list will take O(N) and array takes O(1);
3. insert at head array will take O(N) but linked list will take O(1);

for head , linked list is more optimized
and for tail array is more optimized.
