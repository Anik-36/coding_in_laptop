difference between array and linked list time complexity
1. insert in any postion both are O(N);
2. insert at tail linked list will take O(1) and array takes O(1);
3. insert at head array will take O(N) but linked list will take O(1);

for head , linked list is more optimized
and for tail array is more optimized. also linked list can do by tracking tail.

singly linked list can't access backwardly but we can use recursion to print the singly linked list reversly.
